		<title>Factorio low resources playthrough</title>
	</head>
	<body>
		This is a log of my current playthrough of Factorio. This playthrough has one simple motivation: I like trains. I find the trains in Factorio to be really 
		enjoyable, but also quite unnecessary. In order to make them more necessary I started a game where resources patches were rarer and smaller than normal so
		I would need to create a large train network to bring resources to my base from many distant resource patches. I found that if I set them to be too rare or 
		too small then they just didn't show up at all, so I found the minimum settings where they would actually appear and used those.<br>
		This was originally an image-only log before I decided to make this page, so the descriptions of the first few images are on the images themselves.
		I'll write more detail about them on this page eventually. <br><br>

		I was just attacked for the first time this game. My base defenses easily took care of it, but they did need a bit of repairing afterwards.<br>
		<a href="img/024.png"><img src="thumbs/024.png"></a><br><br>
		My iron supply ran out again so I had to make a new iron outpost. It's uncomfortably close to a rather large enemy base.<br>
		<a href="img/025.png"><img src="thumbs/025.png"></a><br><br>
		I've started my oil processing. This is my oil outpost, which puts oil into barrels and loads them onto a train.<br>
		<a href="img/026.png"><img src="thumbs/026.png"></a><br><br>
		When the train arrives at the base the barrels are unloaded and emptied. The oil is stored in tanks then processed into heavy oil, light oil, and petroleum gas.<br>
		<a href="img/027.png"><img src="thumbs/027.png"></a><br><br>
		The petroleum gas is processed into plastic and sulfur. The sulfur is turned into sulfuric acid which is used to make batteries.<br>
		<a href="img/028.png"><img src="thumbs/028.png"></a><br><br>
		I made a house for Kenneth.<br>
		<a href="img/029.png"><img src="thumbs/029.png"></a><br><br>
		<a href="map3/index.html">Map - 13/01/2017</a><br><br>
		I've finished automating the production of all research packs.<br>
		<a href="img/031.png"><img src="thumbs/031.png"></a><br><br>
		Blue research packs require advanced circuits, so I've automated them. Unfortunately I have nowhere near enough oil to create the amount of plastic this requires, so my next job is to connect more sources of oil to my rail network.<br>
		<a href="img/030.png"><img src="thumbs/030.png"></a><br><br>
		I'm using grenades to destroy trees to uncover an oil field. Don't try this at home.<br>
		<a href="img/032.png"><img src="thumbs/032.png"></a><br><br>
		Quite a large oil outpost. Both my oil outposts are far from enemies so they won't need turrets to defend them.<br>
		<a href="img/033.png"><img src="thumbs/033.png"></a><br><br>
		Some of my regular transport belts aren't keeping up with demand any more so I've started replacing them with fast transport belts. I've automated production of fast transport belts, fast underground belts, and fast splitters because they take annoyingly long to make manually.<br>
		<a href="img/037.png"><img src="thumbs/037.png"></a><br><br>
		Yo dawg, I heard you like assembly machines.<br>
		<a href="img/035.png"><img src="thumbs/035.png"></a><br><br>
		One lone biter wandered into Oil outpost 2... turns out I did need defences there after all.<br>
		<a href="img/036.png"><img src="thumbs/036.png"></a><br><br>
		Whoops. Sorry Kenneth!<br>
		<a href="img/034.png"><img src="thumbs/034.png"></a><br><br>
		Now that I'm making advanced circuits I can use them to make electric furnaces. I've started upgrading my steel furnaces.<br>
		<a href="img/038.png"><img src="thumbs/038.png"></a><br><br>
		<a href="map4/index.html">Map - 18/01/2017</a><br><br>
		Between my solar panels and my steam engines I had enough electricity at daytime, but not enough at night. I need to build some accumulators to store the power generated by the solar panels for use at night, but for now I've just built more steam engines.<br>
		<a href="img/040.png"><img src="thumbs/040.png"></a><br><br>
		My base is close to a very large coal patch, which I intend to use exclusively in my steam engines. There was also a smaller coal patch which I used for everything else, but that ran out.	I had to destroy a large alien base to gain access to a new coal patch.<br>
		<a href="img/039.png"><img src="thumbs/039.png"></a><br><br>
		Here is the finished coal outpost.<br>
		<a href="img/041.png"><img src="thumbs/041.png"></a><br><br>
		I've had to build a new train line for coal. With that built, my base's train station is now finished.<br>
		<a href="img/043.png"><img src="thumbs/043.png"></a><br><br>
		I can use my advanced circuits to make modules. There are speed modules which make a machine work faster, efficiency modules which make a machine use less electricity, and productivity modules which make a machine produce more goods for the same amount of input resources.<br>
		Since oil is scarce I've put productivity modules in all my oil refineries. These modules slow down the oil refineries, so I've built more refineries.<br>
		<a href="img/044.png"><img src="thumbs/044.png"></a><br><br>
		I wasn't sure whether productivity modules or speed modules would be better in my pumpjacks so I performed an experiment. Speed modules won.<br>
		<a href="img/042.png"><img src="thumbs/042.png"></a><br><br>
		I built a tank.<br>
		<a href="img/045.png"><img src="thumbs/045.png"></a><br><br>
		I decided to kill some enemy bases with it.<br>
		<a href="img/047.png"><img src="thumbs/047.png"></a><br><br>
		Then I killed some more enemy bases.<br>
		<a href="img/048.png"><img src="thumbs/048.png"></a><br><br>
		And then some more.<br>
		<a href="img/049.png"><img src="thumbs/049.png"></a><br><br>
		And... well, you get the idea<br>

		Fish live in tanks, right?<br>
		<a href="img/056.png"><img src="thumbs/056.png"></a><br><br>
		I built another coal outpost. It's behind my existing defences so I don't need any turrets here.<br>
		<a href="img/057.png"><img src="thumbs/057.png"></a><br><br>
		I've decided not to use logistics robots in this game since it would require massively restructuring my base. I am going to use construction robots though. I've automated the production of them.<br>
		<a href="img/059.png"><img src="thumbs/059.png"></a><br><br>
		I've created some modular armour and a personal roboport to slot into it. Now the construction robots can charge inside my armour and fly out to build/deconstruct/repair things.<br>
		<a href="img/060.png"><img src="thumbs/060.png"></a><br><br>
		This is the main reason I want the construction robots. When my tank gets damaged they will automatically repair it for me, which makes combat easier.<br>
		<a href="img/061.png"><img src="thumbs/061.png"></a><br><br>
		I guess my new coal outpost did need turrets after all.<br>
		<a href="img/058.png"><img src="thumbs/058.png"></a><br><br>
		My train is bringing in a lot of oil now. I had to build more tanks to store petroleum gas because things were backed up.<br>
		<a href="img/062.png"><img src="thumbs/062.png"></a><br><br>
		I'm desperately low on iron now. After searching around for a long time I've found a large patch to the north. Now I have to clear out lots of aliens so I can safely mine it.<br>
		<a href="img/063.png"><img src="thumbs/063.png"></a><br><br>
		This large iron outpost should hopefully last a while, but I will definitely need to find more iron before I can finish the game. I've now exhausted every iron patch I've found except this one.<br>
		<a href="img/065.png"><img src="thumbs/065.png"></a><br><br>
		I've extended my base west a bit to automate the production of processing units. These will be needed for some of the end game stuff.<br>
		<a href="img/064.png"><img src="thumbs/064.png"></a><br><br>
		<a href="map6/index.html">Map - 26/04/2017</a><br><br>
		I've automated the construction of some combat robots.<br>
		<a href="img/066.png"><img src="thumbs/066.png"></a><br><br>
		They float around me and fight aliens for me.<br>
		<a href="img/073.png"><img src="thumbs/073.png"></a><br><br>
		They work pretty well.<br>
		<a href="img/067.png"><img src="thumbs/067.png"></a><br><br>
		I've spent quite a lot of time clearing out alien bases now that it's so easy, so I have quite a large safe area around my base. I've also spent a lot of time building outposts on resources in this safe area. My base goes through resources very quickly now.<br>
				
		My base now goes through iron so quickly that one cargo wagon on my iron train isn't enough, so I had to add an extra one and modify the station to accommodate it.<br>
		<a href="img/070.png"><img src="thumbs/070.png"></a><br><br>
		I didn't keep a good eye on my coal supply and ended up with huge power problems.<br>
		<a href="img/068.png"><img src="thumbs/068.png"></a><br><br>
		I'm now using oil-based fuel to run my steam engines, with coal still available as a backup.<br>
		<a href="img/069.png"><img src="thumbs/069.png"></a><br><br>
		I've automated the production of some level 3 modules.<br>
		<a href="img/071.png"><img src="thumbs/071.png"></a><br><br>
		I've also made the best armour in the game. It's modular armour with a 10x10 grid. As well as the stuff I had in my previous armour, I now have a fusion reactor, some night vision goggles, and some robot legs to make me run faster.<br>
		<a href="img/072.png"><img src="thumbs/072.png"></a><br><br>
		<a href="map7/index.html">Map - 05/07/2017</a><br><br>
		<hr color="red">
		One good thing about having paths throughout my base is I can use them for some temporary rerouting of resources.<br>
		<a href="img/074.png"><img src="thumbs/074.png"></a><br><br>
		I have a copper shortage and there are no decent iron patches on the map. I need to explore and kill aliens until I find a good amount of copper. Flamethrower ammo doesn't require any copper to produce, so I'll use a flamethrower for this exploration.<br>
		<a href="img/076.png"><img src="thumbs/076.png"></a><br><br>
		The flamethrower in action (everything is green due to night vision).<br>
		<a href="img/077.png"><img src="thumbs/077.png"></a><br><br>
		I now have five pairs of robotic legs and four upgraded energy shields (plus a fifth one which I can swap out one of the roboports for) so I'm considerably faster and stronger on foot than in my tank.<br>
		<a href="img/075.png"><img src="thumbs/075.png"></a><br><br>
		I accidentally set fire to some trees.<br>
		<a href="img/078.png"><img src="thumbs/078.png"></a><br><br>
		Whoops.<br>
		<a href="img/079.png"><img src="thumbs/079.png"></a><br><br>
		Whoops again.<br>
		<a href="img/080.png"><img src="thumbs/080.png"></a><br><br>
		Oh look, iron!<br>
		<a href="img/081.png"><img src="thumbs/081.png"></a><br><br>
		I got an achievement.<br>
		<a href="img/083.png"><img src="thumbs/083.png"></a><br><br>
		I found what I was looking for, a good copper patch.<br>
		<a href="img/082.png"><img src="thumbs/082.png"></a><br><br>
		And right next to it is another one.<br>
		<a href="img/085.png"><img src="thumbs/085.png"></a><br><br>
		Me and Kenneth celebrated by putting some rocket fuel in a train. We were disappointed that it didn't go any faster than normal.<br>
